'Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Monday accused the BJP government of “sabotaging” the winter session of Parliament on flimsy grounds.\r\n\r\n“The Government is mistaken if it thinks that by locking the temple of democracy, it will escape constitutional accountability ahead of the [Gujarat] Assembly elections. Parliament is the forum in which questions should be asked – questions about corruption in high places, conflict of interest of serving ministers and dubious defense deals,” Ms. Gandhi said at a meeting of the Congress Working Committee on Monday.\r\n\r\nThe Prime Minister, Ms. Gandhi stated, had the audacity to have a midnight celebration in Parliament to launch an ill-prepared and flawed GST but today he lacked the courage to face Parliament.\r\n\r\n“The Modi government is also forcefully trying to change the history of modern India by systematically erasing the contributions made by Pandit Nehruji and Indira Gandhi – be it through rewriting school text books, through malicious misinformation and propaganda, or ignoring with disdain the importance of the birth centenary of Indiraji. This vilification is blatant and for all to see,” she alleged.\r\n\r\nOn the Gujarat elections, Ms. Gandhi said that Rahul Gandhi and other colleagues here and in Gujarat were working hard for a “positive result” in that State. “Let us do our best to prove that people are not fooled and that they will make the right decision and defeat the present dispensation there,” she added.\r\n',fake
